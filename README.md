# Hedgehog Facts Spinner ü¶î

Welcome to the **Hedgehog Facts Spinner** ‚Äì a tiny app that does one thing well: sharing delightful facts about hedgehogs!

## What is this?

This is a **super simple JavaScript app** that:
- Shows a random, fun hedgehog fact every time you click the ‚ÄúGet Hedgehog Fact‚Äù button.
- Brightens your day with the random joys of hedgehog trivia.

It was built for a bit of fun, to learn some code, how to commit, and to showcase a tiny bit of creativity. Plus, hedgehogs are pretty cool, obviously.

## How to run it

2. Open the `index.html` file in your favorite browser.
3. Click the button and let the hedgehog magic begin!
4. Or just head to https://jameswilsonlondon.github.io/Hedgehog-play/

No installs, no setup, no fuss ‚Äì just instant hedgehog facts.

## Why?

Because:
- Hedgehogs deserve the spotlight.
- Showing off that you can turn JavaScript into something **delightfully spiky** is a vibe.
