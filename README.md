# Hedgehog Facts Spinner 🦔

Welcome to the **Hedgehog Facts Spinner** – a tiny app that does one thing well: sharing delightful facts about hedgehogs!

## What is this?

This is a **super simple JavaScript app** that:
- Shows a random, fun hedgehog fact every time you click the “Get Hedgehog Fact” button.
- Brightens your day with the random joys of hedgehog trivia.

It was built for a bit of fun, a job interview, and to showcase a tiny bit of creativity. Plus, hedgehogs are the best, obviously.

## How to run it

1. Clone this repo (or download the `index.html` file).
2. Open the `index.html` file in your favorite browser.
3. Click the button and let the hedgehog magic begin!

No installs, no setup, no fuss – just instant hedgehog facts.

## Why?

Because:
- Hedgehogs deserve the spotlight.
- Even in a recruitment interview, it’s good to remember the fun side of code.
- Showing off that you can turn JavaScript into something **delightfully spiky** is a vibe.
